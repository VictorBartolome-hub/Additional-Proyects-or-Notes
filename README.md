# Notes and Projects Repository

This repository contains personal notes, study material, and projects related to physics and related areas.

The purpose of this repository is to organize theoretical work, simulations, and course notes in a structured way, serving both as personal reference and as documentation of ongoing work.

## Current Content

### Introduction to Quantum Computing (Qureca's online course)

Notes covering the basic concepts of quantum computing, including:

- Qubits and quantum states  
- Quantum gates  
- Measurement and unitary evolution  
- Introductory quantum algorithms  

### Study of the NLSE in Optical Fibers

Theoretical and numerical study of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NLSE) in the context of optical fibers. This includes:

- Theoretical background and derivation  
- Analysis of different propagation regimes  
- Numerical simulations for various initial conditions  
- Study of nonlinear propagation effects  

## Ongoing Work

The repository will be updated progressively with new notes and projects in different areas of physics and applied mathematics.
